# CarlaDB: A Real-time Carla Dashboard for Perception & Decision Verification to enhance AI Developer Experience
## 1. Introduction
In August 2025, our team ranked 10th in the End-to-End (E2E) Autonomous Driving Challenge at ICCV. We developed an end-to-end autonomous driving system based on NVIDIA GTRS, integrating Diffusion Policy, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, and additional components to enhance performance.

Our section focuses on the visualization of inference results and performance metrics. Our findings indicate that highly usable development tools significantly improve research efficiency, particularly in autonomous driving, where rapid AI-driven advancements lead to short technology cycles. Simplifying development tools can therefore substantially enhance engineering productivity.

### Carla
CARLA is an open-source autonomous driving simulator widely used for research and development. It provides a high-fidelity simulation environment with diverse urban scenarios, sensor configurations, and traffic conditions. Due to its flexibility and scalability, many autonomous driving benchmarks and state-of-the-art models are developed and evaluated based on CARLA, making it a standard platform for benchmarking and comparative studies in end-to-end autonomous driving research.

### VLA
In robot learning, a vision-language-action model (VLA) is a class of multimodal foundation models that integrates vision, language and actions. Given an input image (or video) of the robot's surroundings and a text instruction, a VLA directly outputs low-level robot actions that can be executed to accomplish the requested task.

### Real-Time Information
In our system, we developed a real-time information dashboard to provide developers with essential testing information. Within the testing environment, the dashboard displays key components—including server and client status, map configuration, vehicle state, and active models—allowing developers to efficiently review and monitor experimental settings.

For testing results, critical driving signals such as speed, heading, throttle, steering, and braking are visualized in real time. Enables developers to quickly identify abnormal behaviors and diagnose potential bugs, significantly improving debugging efficiency.

### Predicted Results
We designed a system that visualizes real-time trajectory prediction. The red points represent target points generated by large-scale route planning, while the green points indicate locally replanned trajectories that adapt in real time to current driving conditions.

The system is implemented in strict accordance with CARLA’s official documentation, allowing future developers to modify and extend it directly, thereby reducing system integration and transition costs.

### Input and Pause System.
We designed an input and pause mechanism that allows developers to pause the system in real time during development. The input interface is compatible with VLA-based operation, and the system automatically pauses when the input panel is activated, enabling smooth and controlled conditional execution.

### Standardized Format.
We adopt JSON-based file formats for inter-module communication, supporting both action-level and trajectory-level outputs. This design ensures compatibility and seamless integration across different models.

## 4. Current Results

The system has been partially implemented and deployed for active development, with the Real-Time Information Dashboard successfully completed and validated through testing. The Input and Pause System and Standardized Format subsystems are designated as the next development phase; their implementations are complete and currently undergoing testing.

All related resources will be released as open source to maximize their impact within the developer community. The images below illustrate the first two subsystems.
